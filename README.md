# Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey/ViolentMonkey Scripts

I used Greasemonkey scripts in Firefox years ago and long before I knew how to code. Then I kind of forgot about it. But one day I was fed up with all the junk on YouTube's main page that I didn't ever want to see again...and I remembered.

Anyway, this may only stay as 1 script, or it may grow into more as I find more uses for it now that I remember.
